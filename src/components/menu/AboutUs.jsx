      <h2>SYSTEMS</h2>
      <h3>(i) Ayurveda:</h3>
      <p>
        The word ‘Ayurveda’ has derived out of fusion of two separate words- Áyu’ i.e. life and ‘veda’ i.e. knowledge. Thus in literal meaning Ayurveda is the science of life. Ayurveda is a classical system of preventive, promotive and curative healthcare originating from the Vedas documented around 5000 years ago and currently recognized and practiced in India and many countries in the world.
      </p>
      <h3>(ii) Unani:</h3>
      <p>
        Unani system of medicine is a comprehensive medical system, which provides preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative health care. The system is holistic in nature and takes into account the whole personality of an individual rather than taking a reductionist approach towards disease. The fundamentals, diagnosis and treatment modalities of the system are based on scientific principles. The basic framework of this system is based on the Hippocratic theory of four Humours, according to which any disturbance in the equilibrium of humours causes disease and therefore the treatment aims at restoring the humoral equilibrium. It is also taken into consideration for identifying the most suitable diet and lifestyle for promoting the health of a particular individual.
      </p>
      <h3>(iii) Siddha:</h3>
      <p>
        The Siddha System of medicine is one of the ancient systems of medicine in India having its close bed with Dravidian culture.

Eighteen Siddhars are said to have contributed towards the systematic development of this system and recorded their experiences in Tamil language.

      <h3>(iv) Yoga:</h3>
      <p>
        The word “Yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to unite or integrate.” Yoga is about the union of a person’s own consciousness and the universal consciousness. The discipline of Yoga consists of eight components namely, restraint (Yama), observance of austerity (Niyama), physical postures (Asana), breathing control (Pranayam), restraining of sense organs (Pratyahar), contemplation (Dharna), meditation (Dhyan) and Deep meditation (Samadhi). These steps in the practice of Yoga have the potential to elevate social and personal behavior and to promote physical health by better circulation of oxygenated blood in the body, restraining the sense organs and thereby inducing tranquility and serenity of mind and spirit. The practice of Yoga has also been found to be useful in the prevention of certain psychosomatic diseases and improves individual resistance and ability to endure stressful situations. Yoga is a promotive, preventive rehabilitative and curative intervention for overall enhancement of health status. A number of postures are described in Yoga literature to improve health, to prevent diseases and to cure illness.

Homoeopathy simply means treating diseases with drugs which are capable of producing symptoms similar to that of disease when taken by healthy people. It is based on the natural law of healing- “Similia Similibus Curantur” which means “likes are cured by likes”. This law was given by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann ( 1755-1843) in the early 19th century. Homoeopathy, serving suffering humanity for over two centuries and has withstood the upheavals of time and has emerged as a time tested therapy.

      <h3>(vii) Sowa Rigpa:</h3>
      <p>
        “Sowa-Rigpa” commonly known as Tibetan system of medicine is one of the oldest, Living and well documented medical tradition of the world. It has been originated from Tibet and popularly practice in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia and Russia. The majority of theory and practice of Sowa-Rigpa is similar to “Ayurveda”. The first Ayurvedic influence came to Tibet during 3rd century AD but it became popular only after 7th centuries with the approach of Buddhism to Tibet. There after this trend of exportation of Indian medical literature, along with Buddhism and other Indian art and sciences were continued till early 19th century. India being the birth place of Buddha and Buddhism has always been favorite place for learning Buddhist art and culture for Tibetan students; lots of Indian scholars were also invited to Tibet for prorogation of Buddhism and other Indian art and sciences. This long association with India had resulted in translation and preservation of thousands of Indian literature on various subjects like religion, sciences, arts, culture and language etc. in Tibetan language. Out of these around twenty-five text related to medicine are also preserved in both canonical and non-canonical forms of Tibetan literatures. Many of these knowledge were further enriched in Tibet with the knowledge and skills of neighboring countries and their own ethnic knowledge. “Sowa-Rigpa” (Science of healing) is one of the classic examples of it.
