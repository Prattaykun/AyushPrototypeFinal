      <h1>Eligibility: (For Startups)</h1>
        <p>
          To be eligible for AYUSH startup registration and receive funding, a startup must meet certain criteria defined by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. AYUSH refers to the traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. Here's an outline of the general criteria and requirements for registration and funding:
        </p>
        <h2>1. Legal Entity Status</h2>
        <p>
          The startup should be a registered entity in India under one of the following legal forms:
          <ul>
            <li>Private Limited Company (under the Companies Act, 2013)</li>
            <li>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</li>
            <li>Partnership Firm</li>
            <li>Registered Sole Proprietorship</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>2. Innovation in AYUSH Sector</h2>
        <p>
          The startup should be working on innovative products, technologies, or services related to the AYUSH sector. This could include:
          <ul>
            <li>Development of new medicinal formulations</li>
            <li>AYUSH-based wellness products or therapies</li>
            <li>Technological innovations in AYUSH treatment delivery (such as apps, online consultation platforms)</li>
            <li>AYUSH-related research and development (R&D)</li>
            <li>Integration of traditional AYUSH practices with modern healthcare</li>
            <li>AYUSH nutraceuticals or cosmeceuticals</li>
            <li>Development of wellness tourism models based on AYUSH principles</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>3. Age of the Startup</h2>

          The startup should generally be less than 7 years old from the date of incorporation.

        </p>
        <h2>4. Turnover</h2>
